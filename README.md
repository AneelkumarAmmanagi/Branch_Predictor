# Branch_Predictor
The proposed perceptron branch predictor combines 
local history XOR hashing with that of global history. 
The local branch history (or self-history) helps to predict 
the branches exhibiting repetitive behaviors. 
# Perceptron 
Perceptron is the simplest model of an artificial neural 
network used for pattern classification. As depicted in 
figure 1, each perceptron keeps track of a weight vector w. 
The w0 is a bias weight to which the corresponding input 
unit is always set to +1. The perceptron receives an input 
vector x. Each input unit xi is associated with a weight wi. 
Perceptron 
The output y, is the dot product of input vector and 
weight vector. The sign of output y serves to make 
prediction, that non-negative output indicates “taken” and 
negative output indicates “not taken”.
